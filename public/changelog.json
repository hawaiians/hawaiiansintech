Your profile will be publicly available at mobbin.com/@{username}, where you can showcase your collections.\n\n## Other improvements\n\n- Collections are now public by default.\n- You can now search for apps from other platforms in the search bar.\n- You can now see the number of comments a screen or flow has on the Saved page as well as on your Collection pages.\n- We've improved the empty state for search results to suggest other popular filters.\n\n## Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where the screen watermarks were not rendering correctly.\n- Fixed an issue where filters were not persisted when switching platforms.\n- Public profiles are completely optional, and your team collections will never appear on your profile."
